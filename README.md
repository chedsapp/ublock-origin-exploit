# UBlock Origin Exploit
Runs javascript on browser through UBO
Meant for use in browsers with bookmarklets disabled for some dumb reason
I'm not sure if it's even considered an exploit so correct me if I am wrong

## How to use
1. Go to UBO extension settings
2. Check the "I am an advanced user" box
3. Hit the cog next to it
4. Set the `userResourcesLocation` setting to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chedsapp/ublock-origin-exploit/main/execute_script.js`
5. Hit "Apply changes"
6. Back in the normal settings go to `My filters` and add this line: `*##+js(execute_script.js)`
7. Done :)
8. Press ctrl + alt + tilde on any website that has ad blocker enabled and input any js code.
